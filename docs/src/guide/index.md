# Overview

This Vite plugin will simplify managing Decap CMS with plugin options.

## Why a Vite plugin?

This plugin uses the [`configResolved`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#configresolved) hook to read the Vite configuration and generate the Decap CMS files with the combination of the Vite configuration and plugin options.
